# Info

A mod that gives certain proc items a cooldown.

The idea of this mod was to reduce lag in the late game and give my pc a breather.

This mod is configurable.

For example the default cooldown value of Sticky Bomb is 0.2 seconds, so Sticky Bomb's is limited to procing 5 times a second.

If theres any bugs or suggestions you can dm me on discord at Sylkadi#5181
