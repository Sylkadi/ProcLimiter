# Info

A mod that gives certain proc items a cooldown, this mod if configuarble with risk of options.

The idea of this mod was to reduce lag in the late game and give my pc a breather.

For example sticky bomb has default cooldown of 0.2 seconds and default stack of 20, so sticky bomb is limited to procing 5 times a second once you reached 20 stacks.

If theres any bugs or suggestions you can dm me on discord at Sylkadi#5181
